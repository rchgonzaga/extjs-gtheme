#summary Target of GTheme

= Introduction =

I have just started working on a very light theme for ExtJS (for now 2.2) inspired from Google apps style (gmail, reader, chrome).
I want to reduce 3D components and if possible image backgrounds.
I would like to recreate a user friendly experience like Google does.
