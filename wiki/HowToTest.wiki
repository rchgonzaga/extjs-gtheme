#summary How to test GTheme Examples

= Introduction =

Get the project from SVN and put it into your htdocs web server folder.
Then try ExtJS examples to check gtheme.

= Example =

I put gtheme project into my root folder of Apache.

I go to: 
http://localhost/gtheme/ext-2.2.1/examples/samples.html
and check all samples.

= How to test = 
THe best example to test gtheme is desktop because it mixes windows, grids, panels..
Test it at:

http://localhost/gtheme/ext-2.2.1/examples/desktop/desktop.html

(you have to get SVN project)

= Make examples =
All the ExtJS folder contains original code (not modified).
The only thing I changed in examples was to add this line:

{{{
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../../../gtheme/gtheme.css" />
}}}

Into html files of examples.

= Examples with GTheme applied = 
You can test gtheme with this examples for now:
 * window
 * grid
 * message-box
 * feed-viewer
 * desktop
